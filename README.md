⭐⭐  [Star this project](https://github.com/JanisZhang/PR-conflicts-alert) ⭐⭐

## Getting Started
- add a `Merge Conflicts` label to repo.
- [Install PR Conflicts Alert App](https://github.com/apps/pr-conflicts-alert).

## Introduction 
We often spend a lot of time manually checking for conflicts in many PRs. The [PR Conflicts Alert](https://github.com/apps/pr-conflicts-alert) GitHub App saves us that trouble. It labels and comments on PRs when they hit conflicts, then tidies up after the issues are resolved.


**No more hunting for conflicts – focus on what really matters!**

## Event Triggers
The app triggers during the following events:
- **Opening** or **reopening** a pull request
- **Synchronization** of pull requests (force-push)
- **When pushing** new code to the master or main branch, it monitors all open 
  pull requests for conflicts.
