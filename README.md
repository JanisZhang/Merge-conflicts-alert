⭐⭐  [Star this project](https://github.com/JanisZhang/PR-conflicts-alert) ⭐⭐

## Getting Started
- add a `Merge Conflicts` label to repo.
- [Install PR Conflicts Alert App](https://github.com/apps/pr-conflicts-alert).

## Introduction 
The [PR Conflicts Alert](https://github.com/apps/pr-conflicts-alert) GitHub 
App automatically labels and adds comments to PRs encountering conflicts, and removes the label after resolution.

The app triggers during the following events:
- **Opening** or **reopening** a pull request
- **Synchronization** of pull requests (force-push)
- **When pushing** new code to the master or main branch, it monitors all open 
  pull requests for conflicts.

## Why
PR conflicts often arose due to unnoticed changes or outdated code, causing delays in the review process. By automating conflict detection and providing immediate alerts, this app fosters smoother collaboration between reviewers and developers.
